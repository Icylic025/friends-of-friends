## Friends of Friends

This project implements a degree of separation calculator for a social network. It allows users to manage friendships, calculate direct and extended connections between individuals, and determine the shortest path of connections using the [Floyd-Warshall algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Warshall_algorithm).

The program supports the following commands given through the console
- i x y: Establish a friendship between person x and person y.
- d x y: Remove the friendship between person x and person y.
- n x: Output the number of direct friends of person x.
- f x: Output the number of friends of friends (excluding direct friends) of person x.
- s x y: Output the shortest degree of separation between person x and person y.
- q: Quit the program.
